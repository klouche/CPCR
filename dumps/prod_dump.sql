It offers researchers improved tools for conducting data queries and feasibility studies. This platform will replace the current Federated Query System, which will be discontinued by December 2024.\nSPHN is expanding its data query capabilities with the new Data Exploration and Analysis System (DEAS). DEAS,  currently being piloted across Swiss university hospitals, will mark a major enhancement of the current Federated Query System (FQS). It will offer researchers a more powerful and user-friendly platform to both, conduct feasibility queries and explore data to support hypothesis generation. DEAS will enable secure access to aggregated data from Swiss hospitals while adhering to the highest privacy standards. Developed in collaboration with University Hospital Zurich (USZ), University Hospital Basel (USB), Inselspital (INSEL), Geneva University Hospitals (HUG), Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), University Children’s Hospital Zurich (KISPI), and technology partner Tune Insight—DEAS is poised to transform data-driven research in Switzerland.	\N	{}	{"clinical trials","data collection","data reuse"}	{completion,conception,development,execution}	{}	{"IT infrastructure"}	{https://sphn.ch/2024/10/17/sphn-launches-a-new-cross-hospital-data-query-tool-deas/}	{}	{}	2025-11-14 12:53:18.911	2025-12-11 12:37:53.869	t	SPHN

SPHN-DCC-06	Ethical framework for the responsible processing of health-related data	{}	\N	Ethical framework for processing and sharing of health-related data\nThe Ethical, Legal and Social Implications advisory group (ELSIag) of the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) was mandated to produce ethical guidance in relation to personal data processing within the SPHN, with particular emphasis on guidance for data sharing. To this aim, the ELSIag has produced an ethical framework (henceforth, the Framework) for the responsible processing of personal data in the SPHN (henceforth, the Network). This framework was then endorsed by the Swiss Biobanking Platform (SBP) and the ETH Domain Strategic Focus Area on Personalised Health and Related Technologies (PHRT). The methodology that led to this Framework included a systematic analysis of international guidelines and it is described in a separate document (available at: https://www.sphn.ch/en/about/publications.html). The Framework provides ethical guidance to the partners of the Network as to the collection, storage, analysis and sharing of personal data for research purposes. Health-related personal data are often derived from human biological material.\nBoth data and human biological material are addressed in this new version of the Framework.\nCompliance with Swiss laws and with this Framework are requirements for participation in the SPHN funding schemes and activities. The Swiss Biobanking Platform is elaborating tools, guidelines and technical standards for the processing and proper use of human biological material. Participating institutions are advised to refer to such standards for quality-related and other technical issues concerning the processing and appropriate handling of human biological material.\nThe purpose of the Framework is to ensure that scientific activities in relation to personal data and human biological material conducted in the context of the SPHN meet adequate standards of ethical responsibility, promote the rights, interests and well-being of research participants, ensure the efficient production of valuable scientific knowledge, and generate public trust around the activities of the Network.\nThe Framework refers to all data types and human biological material that can be usefully employed in the context of health research. This includes health-related personal data and human biological material that were not originally collected for research purposes, as well as data that are not conventionally associated with the practice of medical research (such as geolocalization data, social media content, data from commercial portable sensors, and the like).\nThe Framework is built on four general principles: respect for persons, privacy, data fairness and accountability. Each principle is followed by a set of specific guidelines intended to assist participating institutions to abide by the principles.	\N	{}	{"data collection","data reuse"}	{}	{"ethics submission",ppi}	{standards}	{https://sphn.ch/document/ethical-framework/}	{}	{elsi@sphn.ch}	2025-11-14 12:53:16.971	2025-12-11 12:37:48.222	t	SPHN

SPHN-DCC-05	Guidelines for the return of actionable findings	{}	\N	Ethical guidelines for principal investigators\nThis document contains recommendations to ensure ethically responsible handling of primary and secondary genetic research findings that have potential medical relevance for individual research participants involved in SPHN-funded studies.\nThis document only addresses findings in genetic research. Findings of medical relevance to research participants are also common in other types of health research. For incidental findings in imaging, the swissethics report “Richtlinie zum Umgang mit Zufallsbefunden in der medizinischen Forschung” can be consulted.1\nThe aim of these recommendations is to raise awareness in SPHN-grantees about the medical and ethical importance of defining a clear strategy for reporting of research findings to research participants. At the same time, they offer concrete indications about how to meet the ethical obligations of researchers towards research participants. Adherence to the recommendations presented here will promote more harmonized and accountable decisions in this ethically sensitive issue and will increase public trust in SPHN as well as in SPHN-grantees.\nThese recommendations align with existing regulatory provisions on this subject. They also have taken into account the current template of the General Consent (version 2.0 of February 2019). While these guidelines suggest specific measures on reporting genetic findings, they do not prescribe specific implementation strategies nor do they serve as a compliance tool. Funded institutions and research groups will be responsible for effective implementation of the recommendations by asking researchers to adhere to these recommendations. Institutions can decide themselves if they wish to develop additional tools to enable and monitor compliance with these guidelines.2	\N	{}	{"data collection","data reuse"}	{completion,development,execution}	{"ethics submission",ppi}	{standards}	{https://sphn.ch/document/reporting-actionable-genetic-findings-to-research-participants/}	{}	{elsi@sphn.ch}	2025-11-14 12:53:16.54	2025-12-11 12:37:52.37	t	SPHN
SPHN-DCC-07	SPHN Dataset (semantic framework)	{}	\N	Provision of a harmonized framework for the semantic description of health-related data (Concepts)\nCollection of requirements from the research community/projects and building a national consensus for semantic data definitions.\nTerminology service\nAll SPHN concepts are represented in the SPHN Dataset \nThe SPHN Dataset contains all SPHN concepts, their general and contextualized descriptions, value sets and information about the connected semantic standards. \nSPHN concepts are generalizable building blocks, which can be used in different contexts. Each concept contains all information necessary to understand it, and concepts can be combined to composed concepts, which again can be combined to more complex compositions. It is important to find the right level between abstraction and granularity to optimize the power of expression. The approach can be illustrated with the example of “substance”. A substance can be an active or inactive ingredient of a drug or it can be the substance someone is allergic to. Therefore, we can abstract “substance” as a concept on its own. The concept of substance is composed of three concepts: “code”, “generic name” and “quantity”. These concepts describe a substance no matter if it is the active ingredient of a drug (that is defined as the type “substance”) or the substance to which someone is allergic to.    \nTo make the SPHN concepts comparable nationally and internationally, we express their meaning using existing semantic standards (controlled vocabularies), by creating a meaning binding wherever possible to SNOMED CT and/or LOINC. The data element of a concept can be expressed using one or several recommended standards (e.g. LOINC, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, ICD-O-3, CHOP, ATC). For example, the instance of substance code under the concept “allergy” can be an ATC code, a SNOMED CT code, or a code form another semantic standard. If needed value sets are defined and if possible, a value set binding to SNOMED CT is added. Descriptions for concepts and value sets as well as standards are, whenever possible, aligned with national and international sources.	\N	{}	{"clinical trials","data collection","data reuse"}	{completion,conception,development,execution}	{}	{consulting,"IT infrastructure",standards,templates}	{https://sphn.ch/document/sphn-dataset/,https://sphn.ch/network/data-coordination-center/the-sphn-semantic-interoperability-framework/}	{}	{}	2025-11-14 12:53:17.146	2025-12-11 12:40:28.126	t	SPHN

These include:\n    Creating de-identification recommendations in compliance with Swiss legal requirements\n    Development of harmonized governance strategy for using and reusing health-related data in multi-centre projects\n    Investigating frameworks for using health-related data in non-research projects (e.g. diagnostic use in clinical settings) \n    Enhancing SPHN legal agreement templates including simplifying templates, adding support for sample sharing, and sharing registry data\n    Alignment on activities relates to data sharing obstacles in practical research\n\nContractual Framework for Multi-Center Projects\nResearch projects sharing sensitive personal health data between institutions require a legal agreement. SPHN offers a nationally harmonized contractual framework with a series of templates for legal agreements adaptable to various collaboration setups. These agreements define key principles of the collaboration (data use, ownership, publications, intellectual property and liability) and outline the rights, obligations and responsibilities of all parties involved (e.g. Investigator, Data Provider, Data Recipient, Processor, etc.).\nLegal Agreement Templates - a strong foundation for collaborations\nThe SPHN legal agreement templates, refined through eight years of experience with complex, multi-institutional projects, provide a strong foundation for collaborations. Incorporating insights from the SPHN National Data Streams projects (NDS) and the Data Governance Working Group (DGWG), these templates address key legal considerations, providing a national harmonization of several key issues related to nation-wide data sharing. While tailored for Switzerland, they can also serve as a basis to set up legal frameworks in international collaborations.   \nDownload Legal Agreement Templates\nMulti-center research projects typically require a Consortium Agreement integrating a Data Transfer and Use Agreement (DTUA) and Data Transfer and Processing Agreement (DTPA).  Further templates listed below offer options for specific configurations.  \nConsortium Agreement + DTUA + DTPA \nSpecifies the parties’ collaboration, their rights and obligations according to project plan and funding decision\nDescribes governance structure between project leader, sponsor, investigators and defines executive and scientific board\nRegulates financial conditions, confidentiality, intellectual property, publications, exit and further warranties\nReflects the agreement between the parties regarding the terms governing the processing, security and sharing of data under the Consortium Agreement\nDescribes terms and conditions for providing data by the provider, who is the controller of the data, to recipient, who wishes to conduct the research project. It specifies:\n            Data processing\n            Liability and third party rights\n            Miscellaneous items, such as force majeure\n            Security requirements for recipient and external processor ensuring appropriate confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the systems with regard to processing of the data.	\N	{}	{"data collection","data reuse"}	{conception,development}	{"ethics submission",ppi,"regulatory and contracts"}	{consulting,templates}	{https://sphn.ch/services/dtua/,https://www.biomedit.ch/home/scientific-services/elsi-consultancy.html}	{}	{elsi@sphn.ch}	2025-11-14 12:53:15.828	2025-12-11 12:37:51.999	t	SPHN
SPHN-DCC-08	SPHN RDF Schema	{}	\N	Provision of a standardized framework for the storage and transport of health-related data with minimal information loss \nHealth-related data, ranging from hospital routine data to biomedical research data, are quite diverse, stored in different databases and formats, and often coded in local standards. This fragmentation and diversity make it very time-consuming to combine data from different sources for doing research on a particular topic. It is generally difficult to understand data and the intended meaning due to the lack of common standards, metadata, or a common data dictionary. Following the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles, SPHN builds an infrastructure to overcome these hurdles and enables collaborative research by making the meaning of health-related data understandable to humans and machines. This allows for an easy combination of the data from different sources, thus simplifying the use and exploration of data across Switzerland. Experience shows that the diverse needs and requirements of the different use cases make it impossible to agree on one single data model. Not only the required data elements differ between projects, but also the level of information granularity required for a single datapoint can vary significantly. Therefore, SPHN developed a framework based on a strong semantic layer of information (pillar 1), and graph technologies for the exchange layer, which can be extended by the individual projects to fit their purposes (pillar 2). Thus, a universal exchange language for healthcare is established, using the "words" from various international standard vocabularies (such as SNOMED CT or LOINC), a simple "grammar" (subject-predicate-object; expressed in RDF), and additional SPHN guidelines and rules to establish good practices for FAIR data.\nThe SPHN RDF Schema provides an interoperable framework for conveying information and storing health-related data from SPHN-related projects using Semantic Web technologies including RDF (see background section on RDF). The schema facilitates the integration of existing external resources within the SPHN Semantic Interoperability Framework. The SPHN RDF Schema is based on the SPHN Dataset (available at: https://sphn.ch/document/sphn-dataset/) and transforms its elements into a formal structure (see Figure 1).\nSPHN concepts are generalizable building blocks, which can be used in different contexts. Each concept contains all information necessary to understand it, and concepts can be combined to composed concepts, which again can be combined to more complex compositions. It is important to find the right level between abstraction and granularity to optimize the power of expression. The approach can be illustrated with the example of “substance”. A substance can be an active or inactive ingredient of a drug or it can be the substance someone is allergic to. Therefore, we can abstract “substance” as a concept on its own. The concept of substance is composed of three concepts: “code”, “generic name” and “quantity”. These concepts describe a substance no matter if it is the active ingredient of a drug (that is defined as the type “substance”) or the substance to which someone is allergic to.   \nSemantics Image 2\nTo make the SPHN concepts comparable nationally and internationally, we express their meaning using existing semantic standards (controlled vocabularies), by creating a meaning binding wherever possible to SNOMED CT and/or LOINC. The data element of a concept can be expressed using one or several recommended standards (e.g. LOINC, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, ICD-O-3, CHOP, ATC). For example, the instance of substance code under the concept “allergy” can be an ATC code, a SNOMED CT code, or a code form another semantic standard. If needed value sets are defined and if possible, a value set binding to SNOMED CT is added. Descriptions for concepts and value sets as well as standards are, whenever possible, aligned with national and international sources.	\N	{}	{"clinical trials","data collection","data reuse"}	{completion,conception,development,execution}	{}	{consulting,"IT infrastructure",standards,templates}	{"Regulary updated.

SPHN-DCC-09	SPHN Connector	{}	\N	Facilitation of the transformation of different  SPHN-compliant data formats into RDF \nThe SPHN Connector is a tool developed to facilitate the creation of valid SPHN-compliant graph data based on relational, semantically described data from data-providing institutions.The connector creates an input interface based on an RDF Schema conforming to the SPHN Semantic Interoperability Framework. The ingested data is converted into RDF, validated to check its conformity with the schema, and de-identified.\nThe SPHN Connector is a dockerized solution that allows data-providing institutions to build a pipeline that converts their data from relational or JSON sources into graph data based on an RDF schema conforming to the SPHN Framework. The ingested data is converted into RDF and validated to check its conformity with the schema. Optionally, data providers that do not have an in-house de-identification functionality, can activate the module for de-identification in the SPHN Connector.\nThe SPHN Connector integrates a variety of tools developed or distributed by the DCC like the SHACLer or the Quality Assurance Framework to simplify the production of high quality data. In the context of SPHN, the SPHN Connector is intended to and can be used by any data provider for an easier creation and validation of data in RDF.\nThe SPHN Connector is build with flexibility and simplicity in mind. It expects only two elements: The input data is provided on a patient level and the base schema which can be the SPHN RDF Schema and optionally a project-specific RDF Schema.\nAlmost everything else can be adapted by the user to fit its needs, skills and the working environment. One example is the bandwidth of input data that is supported by the connector. A user can upload JSON files, RDF files or setup a specific database import. The setup of the validation is also user centric. Experienced users can provided their own SHACL file for validation while others can simply use the file that is created by the connector via the SHACLer.	\N	{}	{"clinical trials","data reuse"}	{execution}	{"project management"}	{consulting,"IT infrastructure"}	{https://sphn.ch/2023/10/19/sphn-connector-public-release/}	{}	{}	2025-11-14 12:53:17.498	2025-12-11 12:37:52.725	t	SPHN

SPHN-DCC-21	Public-private (P2) collaboration framework	{}	\N	Consortium providing results of data analyses to industry (and other) partners \nSPHN acts as a trusted partner between hospitals and private companies \nA new collaboration framework allows private partners to transform Swiss health data into actionable insights without touching any sensitive information. The first pilot project of its kind is now nearing completion. \nHospitals in the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) host a wealth of real-world data from over 700’000 patients who have given their general consent. With the new framework for public-private collaborations, pharmaceutical companies can answer simple research questions without accessing personal health data. These results can be translated into health care solutions for patients. \nThe process for this collaboration is as simple as it is privacy-preserving: Novartis has submitted a research question concerning a risk factor for heart disease. The hospitals transferred the necessary data in anonymized form to the Trusted Research Environment BioMedIT, where SPHN’s Data Coordination Center conducted the analysis and delivered aggregated results back to Novartis. No personal data is shared with the industry partner. \nAs only summarized results are shared with the company, the project complies with the high ethical standards of SPHN for responsible data sharing and public-private partnerships.	\N	{}	{"data collection","data reuse","sample collection"}	{}	{"ethics submission","project management","regulatory and contracts"}	{consulting}	{https://sphn.ch/document/guidance-on-elsi-challenges-for-the-further-use-of-genomic-data/}	{}	{info@sphn.ch}	2025-11-14 12:53:19.608	2025-12-11 12:40:29.825	t	SPHN

This could include among others molecular / omics data, patient data from hospitals and clinics, or clinical research data. With these guidelines,\nSPHN aims to support the negotiation of ethically robust and fair conditions for such PPPs.\nThe types of data referred to in this document are those generated or used within the context of SPHN-funded research, but not yet shared within a PPP. Finally, a reminder that clinical data generated in health contexts (e.g., medical history, treatment data) is governed by regulations beyond those specific to a research setting, that must also be taken into account.\nThis document seeks to support parties during the negotiation phase and is intended to supplement legal agreements. Templates for legal agreements which are suitable for PPPs can be found on the SPHN Website (https://sphn.ch/services/dtua/). SPHN-funded grantees must follow these guidelines when entering PPPs. Upon the completion of a PPP agreement involving SPHN data, the parties must report to the SPHN Management Office the specifics of how they met the guidelines.
